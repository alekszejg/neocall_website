AFTERWARDS: 
- Industry routes/pages localizations
- ( Maybe ) Form: replace href=#form-id for buttons with actual form as modal

GLOBAL QUALITY OF LIFE IMPROVEMENTS: 
- Nginx + Certbot: make separate docker-compose with its own .env variables
- Other composes: remove nginx and certbot services 
- Docker/Server: all volumes need to be in fixed spot which won't be changed
